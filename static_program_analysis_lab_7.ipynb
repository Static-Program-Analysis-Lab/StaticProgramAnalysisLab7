    "## &#128214; Exercise 1: Building a Call Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#127919; Objective\n",
    "In the preceding exercises, you've delved into class hierarchy analysis and points-to analysis. \n",
    "Now, it's time to leverage the information from the points-to analysis to construct a Call Graph. \n",
    "A Call Graph illustrates the calling relationships between functions or methods in a program, which is instrumental in performing interprocedural analysis. \n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to generate a Call Graph that integrates the points-to information to achieve a more accurate representation of the possible method invocations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#128214; Background\n",
    "A Call Graph is a directed graph where nodes represent methods or functions, and edges signify the calling relationships. \n",
    "However, in object-oriented languages, the exact method being called may depend on the runtime type of the object. \n",
    "Points-to analysis helps to over-approximate the possible types an object variable can point to, and thereby the possible methods that can be called.\n",
    "\n",
    "### &#10145; Tasks\n",
    "1. Utilize the points-to set information from the previous exercise to determine the possible target methods for each method call.\n",
    "2. Create nodes for each method and edges for each method invocation identified. An edge from method A to method B signifies that method A calls method B."

    "### Helper Function Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, both class instantiation and function calling use the same syntax which leads to an ambiguity when analyzing the AST of a code snippet. \n",
    "Specifically, both operations appear as `ast.Call` nodes within the AST, which makes it difficult to distinguish between the two just by examining the syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider the following Python code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = MyClass()  # Class instantiation\n",
    "my_function()    # Function call\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the AST, both `MyClass()` and `my_function()` will be represented as `ast.Call` nodes, which could lead to misinterpretation during analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue and provide clearer analysis, we present a helper function that traverses the AST to identify and categorize all class and function definitions. \n",
    "This will later help in accurately interpreting `ast.Call` nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class and Function Analyzer\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a class `ClassFunctionAnalyzer` which inherits from `ast.NodeVisitor`. \n",
    "This class overrides three methods: `visit_ClassDef`, `visit_FunctionDef`, and `visit_Call`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ClassFunctionAnalyzer(ast.NodeVisitor):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",

    "        else:\n",
    "            return \"unknown\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__`: Initializes two sets, `classes` and `functions`, to store the names of classes and functions respectively.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- `visit_ClassDef`: This method is invoked for every `ast.ClassDef` node encountered. It adds the name of the class to the `classes` set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `visit_FunctionDef`: This method is invoked for every `ast.FunctionDef` node encountered. It adds the name of the function to the `functions` set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `visit_Call`: This method is invoked for every `ast.Call` node encountered. It checks whether the called entity is a class or a function by comparing the identifier against the collected sets of class and function names.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this helper function, you will be able to determine whether an `ast.Call` node represents a class instantiation or a function call, which is important for the points-to analysis you will be performing.\n",
    "Of course, this solution is not optimal/perfect since we might have different functions with the same name in a program, but for simplicity we make the hypothesis that functions are unique. "

    "### Instructions for Implementing a Call Graph Builder in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "&#128161; In Python, it's not mandatory for code to be enclosed within a function. \n",
    "In this scenario, we'll assume the root to serve a similar purpose to the main method found in other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using the `CallGraphBuilder` class, a subclass of `ast.NodeVisitor`, to implement a system for constructing a call graph in Python. This class is designed to analyze Python code and build a graph that represents the relationships between function and method calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects to focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class and Function Context**: The `CallGraphBuilder` maintains two stacks - `function_stack` and `class_stack`. The `function_stack` tracks the current function context, while the `class_stack` keeps track of the current class context. This setup helps in accurately identifying where each function or method is being called.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Method Calls**: The class is equipped to handle method calls (e.g., `obj.method()`). When a method call is encountered, it's processed to determine the caller and callee, and this relationship is added to the call graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Graph Construction**: The `call_graph` attribute of the `CallGraphBuilder` instance will store the call graph. It's a `CallGraph` object that holds the edges representing the call relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visiting Different Node Types**: The class overrides methods like `visit_ClassDef`, `visit_FunctionDef`, `visit_Expr`, and `visit_Assign` to handle different types of AST nodes. This ensures that all relevant Python constructs are analyzed to build the call graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement this `CallGraphBuilder` class to analyze Python source code and build a call graph. "
